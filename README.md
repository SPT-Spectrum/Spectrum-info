What is Spectrum?
SPECTRUM (SPT) is a decentralized online shopping aims to improve the e-commerce system
for buyers and sellers. As a rapidly growing business sector, e-commerce continues to open up
new avenues for exploring, comparing and purchasing products worldwide. Such popular online
platforms have no doubt transformed the way in which we shop and live. Access, convenience,
low prices and the availability of a large selection of products are among the many benefits
these platforms deliver to consumers. But such benefits provided by centralized corporations
come at a cost — increased prices, process inefficiencies and aggressive marketing using huge
amounts of personal data.

technology for buyers and sellers by automating functions currently performed by “middlemen”
marketplaces like Amazon, eBay and Alibaba. The system is a less expensive and more secure
online commerce experience for all participants that reach through a global blockchain-based
inventory system. Spectrum users will save time and money through its automated e-commerce
functions.
